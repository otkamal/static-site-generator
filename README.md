## Overview
This is the 3rd project that I've worked on following the instruction laid out on [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev). 

## Pain Points
Overall, I'm pretty happy with the completion of this project, but there is definitely room for improvement:
- **Code Structure** -  I really don't like how I structured the project. If I worked on this again, I'd want to clean up mdprocessing and just how I organized code in general.
